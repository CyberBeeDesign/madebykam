# Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code of **Kamel Zehani's portfolio website**!  
This project showcases my work, skills, and background as a front-end developer.

## üöÄ About

**MadeByKam** is a modern, responsive portfolio built with React.  
It features my latest projects, an about section, and a contact form for collaboration or inquiries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Techniques

- **React**: Component-based architecture for maintainable and scalable UI.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for seamless navigation between pages.
- **CSS Modules**: Custom, responsive layouts with media queries for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Flexbox**: Used for flexible, adaptive layouts across all sections.
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in and slide-in effects using CSS transitions and React state.
- **EmailJS**: Enables direct email sending from the contact form without a backend.
- **Absolute & Relative Positioning**: For creative placement of images and design elements.
- **Custom Hamburger Menu**: Responsive navigation with dropdown for mobile/tablet.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and accessible navigation links.

## üñ•Ô∏è Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Wide layouts, side margins, and full navigation.
- **Tablet/Mobile**: Hamburger menu, dropdown navigation, stacked sections, and touch-friendly UI.

## ‚ú® How It Works

1. **Navigation**:  
   - Desktop: Menu and socials always visible.
   - Tablet/Mobile: Hamburger toggles dropdown menu and socials.

2. **Animations**:  
   - Hero and section images fade/slide in on load.
   - Portfolio cards animate as they enter the viewport.

3. **Contact Form**:  
   - Validates input before sending.
   - Uses EmailJS to deliver messages directly to my inbox.
